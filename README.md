Vulnerability:

TightVNC Connection without Authentication

Vulnerability Overview:

TightVNC (Virtual Network Computing) connection without authentication exposes a critical security vulnerability where unauthorized users can gain direct access to the desktop and resources of the affected system.

Vulnerability Impact:
1.	Unauthorized Access: Attackers can connect to the system remotely without needing a password, effectively bypassing any authentication requirements.
2.	Data Breach: Once connected, attackers can view, modify, or delete sensitive data stored on the compromised system.
3.	System Compromise: Attackers can install malware, perform system changes, or escalate privileges to gain further control over the system.
4.	Availability: In addition to unauthorized access, an open RDP connection without authentication can lead to denial-of-service attacks by consuming system resources or disrupting legitimate access.

Pre-requisites for lab setup:
1.	Kali Linux Machine.
2.	Windows Machine.
3.	Nessus Tool [https://www.tenable.com/downloads/nessus?loginAttempted=true].

Step to Reproduce:
1. Install Nessus on Kali Linux.

11. View the identified vulnerability on the target machine by open the generated report.
    ![scan_](https://github.com/Dinesh35678/Nessus-Vulnerability-Management/assets/99108512/92856174-1d0b-4246-998a-f45d7b1abc26)
12. We had identified that VNC Remote connection does not contains any authentication.
    ![manual_1](https://github.com/Dinesh35678/Nessus-Vulnerability-Management/assets/99108512/7ac18bf6-c5aa-431c-92c4-c95a1c225b00)
13. Successfully login to the target machine.
    ![manual_2](https://github.com/Dinesh35678/Nessus-Vulnerability-Management/assets/99108512/4ea90a83-9013-4731-bf4d-ca0313a6cca8)

Remediation:
Set the strong password to mitigate VNC Remote connection vulnerability.
